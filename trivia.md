### What is REST
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  A architectural design principle to make
network communications scalable and flexible. In short, it is any design
that has follows the Fielding constraints.

1) Client-Server: When you browse the internet, your computer (client) sends
HTTP requests to a server. It is a one-to-one communication.

2) Stateless: It means that the server does not keep track of past requests.  
Each request is treated as standalone.

3) Uniform Interface
   a) A GET request to URI and if it is a 200 level response and HTML is provided
   then it is rendered onto the page.
   b) The server receives a representation of what the new resource should look
   like.
   c) Resources are manipulated through CRUD operations (create, read, update,  
   and delete)
